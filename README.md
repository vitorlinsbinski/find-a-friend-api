<h1 align = "center">Find a Friend API</h1>

<p>This back-end application was developed as a challenge for the third chapter of the course about NodeJS, by Rocketseat.</p>

<p>"Find a Friend" is a pet adoption project that simplifies the process of discovering with pets available for adoption in your city.</p>

<p>Organizations can sign up on the application and register pets for adoption. That way, these animals will show up for people who want to adopt  one(s) of them.</p>

<p>During the API development, it was applied some <strong>Design Patterns</strong> and <strong>SOLID Principles</strong>, like Single Responsability, Dependency Inversion, Repository Pattern, Factory Pattern, Test-Driven-Development (TDD), Controllers, etc.</p>

## Requirements to run the project

<p>Before you run the project, check if you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine, as well [Git](https://git-scm.com) to clone this repository.</p>

<p>Besides, you must have Docker installed on your machine to run the PostgreSQL database image in a container.</p>

<p>You must create a ".env" file. Check the ".env" example provided in the root directory with the required variables for the project.</p>

## Running the application

```bash
    # Clone this repository on your machine:
    $ git clone https://github.com/vitorlinsbinski/find-a-friend-api.git

    # Access the project folder in your terminal:
    $ cd find-a-friend-api

    # Install all dependencies:
    $ npm install

    # Install and initialize the database container in Docker:
    $ docker compose up -d

    # Run the application:
    $ npm run dev
```

<p>After that, you may use some API Client to send HTTP requests to the server, like Insomnia, Postman, etc.</p>

## Tests

<p>In this project, Vitest was used as a testing tool to provide us E2E (end-to-end) tests in our routes and unit-tests in our use-cases.</p>

<span>Command to run the unit tests: </span>

```bash
    npm run test
```

<span>Command to run the E2E tests: </span>

```bash
    npm run test:e2e
```

Disclaimer: it's better to run this application if you are using Unix-based operational Systems, like Linux, MacOS or even WSL 2.
